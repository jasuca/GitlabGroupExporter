# About code

* This code written in python possibly has many unanticipated improvements. It is not a program designed at a productive level contemplating all the possible errors that may exist.

* It is only a functional program designed to automate.

* As for the python code itself, possible improvements are welcome. I am not a 100% experienced python programmer, but I am having fun. Enjoy :)
